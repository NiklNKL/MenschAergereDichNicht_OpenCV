/**
  Leave-One-Out cross-validator

  Provides train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. Each sample is used once as a test set (singleton) while the remaining samples form the training set.

  Note: LeaveOneOut() is equivalent to KFold(n_splits=n) and LeavePOut(p=1) where n is the number of samples.

  Due to the high number of test sets (which is the same as the number of samples) this cross-validation method can be very costly. For large datasets one should favor KFold, ShuffleSplit or StratifiedKFold.

  @see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut.html
