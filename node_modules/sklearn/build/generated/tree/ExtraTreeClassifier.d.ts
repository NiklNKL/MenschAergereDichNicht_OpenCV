  An extremely randomized tree classifier.

  Extra-trees differ from classic decision trees in the way they are built. When looking for the best split to separate the samples of a node into two groups, random splits are drawn for each of the max_features randomly selected features and the best split among those is chosen. When max_features is set 1, this amounts to building a totally random decision tree.

  Warning: Extra-trees should only be used within ensemble methods.
