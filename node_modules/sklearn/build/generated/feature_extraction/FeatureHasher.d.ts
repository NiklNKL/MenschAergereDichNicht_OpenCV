/**
  Implements feature hashing, aka the hashing trick.

  This class turns sequences of symbolic feature names (strings) into scipy.sparse matrices, using a hash function to compute the matrix column corresponding to a name. The hash function employed is the signed 32-bit version of Murmurhash3.

  Feature names of type byte string are used as-is. Unicode strings are converted to UTF-8 first, but no Unicode normalization is done. Feature values must be (finite) numbers.

  This class is a low-memory alternative to DictVectorizer and CountVectorizer, intended for large-scale (online) learning and situations where memory is tight, e.g. when running prediction code on embedded devices.
