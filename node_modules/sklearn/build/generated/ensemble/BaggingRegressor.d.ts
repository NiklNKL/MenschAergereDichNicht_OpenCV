/**
  A Bagging regressor.

  A Bagging regressor is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base regressors each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.

  This algorithm encompasses several works from the literature. When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the samples, then this algorithm is known as Pasting [1]. If samples are drawn with replacement, then the method is known as Bagging [2]. When random subsets of the dataset are drawn as random subsets of the features, then the method is known as Random Subspaces [3]. Finally, when base estimators are built on subsets of both samples and features, then the method is known as Random Patches [4].
