/**
  (Error-Correcting) Output-Code multiclass strategy.

  Output-code based strategies consist in representing each class with a binary code (an array of 0s and 1s). At fitting time, one binary classifier per bit in the code book is fitted.  At prediction time, the classifiers are used to project new points in the class space and the class closest to the points is chosen. The main advantage of these strategies is that the number of classifiers used can be controlled by the user, either for compressing the model (0 < code_size < 1) or for making the model more robust to errors (code_size > 1). See the documentation for more details.
